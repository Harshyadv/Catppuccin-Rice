# 🧃 Catppuccin-Rice

This is what happens when you **want that minimalist WM look**...  
but can’t commit to 500 lines of `config` and Lua sorcery 😅  
(**Spoiler:** I still ended up editing config files anyway.)

A hybrid aesthetic rice combining **retro UI layout** with **modern colors and iconography**, powered by **Catppuccin Mocha** and **KDE Plasma**.  
Looks like a window manager, behaves like a DE.  
Perfect for lazy perfectionists™.
